                  Privacy is a fundamental right. NABU VPN operates on the principle 
                  of minimal data collection and maximum user privacy protection. 
                  We have designed our service to collect as little information as 
                  possible while maintaining operational functionality.

                  NABU VPN does not collect, log, store, or track any data related 
                  to VPN usage other than machine aggregate network bandwidth usage. 
                  No VPN data is persisted beyond what is necessary for service 
                  operation. All VPN traffic is encrypted end-to-end.

                <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
                  We make every reasonable effort to ensure your privacy and maintain

                  NABU VPN accounts are created using the public key address of a 
                  Cardano mainnet wallet. This approach provides a pseudoanonymous 
                  unique identifier for account ownership without requiring traditional 
                  personal information such as email addresses or social media accounts.

                <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
                  All account information is derived from publicly available data 
                  published to the Cardano blockchain. As such, there is no expectation 
                  of privacy regarding account existence or expiration dates, as this 
                  information is publicly verifiable on the blockchain.

                  user activity or traffic.

                  Users should be aware that logging into online accounts while using 
                  the VPN may expose additional information. To maintain maximum 
                  privacy, consider using different accounts for VPN and non-VPN 
                  activities to prevent correlation of your real and VPN IP addresses.
